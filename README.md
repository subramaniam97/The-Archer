# The-Archer
A fun game!

The Archer is a fun game! 

The game has been developed in C++ with the help of graphics.h library. An archer is displayed on the left side of the screen and 
the user can manoeuvre the archer vertically. Balloons constantly pop up from the bottom of the screen. The objective of the game 
is to shoot as many balloons as possible. The speed with which balloons travel upwards increases as the game progresses into higher
levels. The user loses a life on missing a balloon. The game ends when the user is out of lives.

A file is used to update the highscore and is done using file handling (read and write) concepts.
